# Pay_with_PayPal_Java


In this project I implemented a pay with paylpal feature which can be integrate with any java web website.

I used the [PayPal Java Sdk](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Java-SDK/tree/master/rest-api-sample) to build this feature.

Basically The project have 2 servlets one which make a post request to paypal standbox account and another one which work with a checkout with paypal button in front end to make a payment.


The project is build with maven and Netbean you will need to have them to run it
